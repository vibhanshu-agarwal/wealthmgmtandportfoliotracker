# MongoDB MCP Server Setup

This skill guides users through configuring the MongoDB MCP server for use with an agentic client.

## Overview

The MongoDB MCP server requires authentication. Users have three options:

1. **Connection String** (Option A): Direct connection to a specific cluster
   - Quick setup for single cluster
   - Requires `MDB_MCP_CONNECTION_STRING` environment variable

2. **Service Account Credentials** (Option B): MongoDB Atlas Admin API access
   - **Recommended for Atlas users** - simplifies authentication and data access
   - Access to Atlas Admin API and dynamic cluster connection via `atlas-connect-cluster`
   - No manual DB user credential management
   - Requires `MDB_MCP_API_CLIENT_ID` and `MDB_MCP_API_CLIENT_SECRET` environment variables

3. **Atlas Local** (Option C): Local development with Docker
   - **Best for local testing** - zero configuration required
   - Runs Atlas locally in Docker, requires Docker installed
   - No credentials or cloud cluster access

This is an interactive step-by-step guide. The agent detects the user's environment and provides tailored instructions, but **never asks for or handles credentials** — users add those directly to their shell profile in Step 5. Make this clear to the user whenever credentials come up in Steps 3a and 3b.

## Step 1: Check Existing Configuration

Before starting the setup, check if the user already has the required environment variables configured.

Run this command to check for existing configuration (masking values to avoid exposing credentials):

```bash
env | grep "^MDB_MCP" | sed '/^MDB_MCP_READ_ONLY=/!s/=.*/=[set]/'
```

**Interpretation:**

- If `MDB_MCP_CONNECTION_STRING` is set → connection string auth is configured
- If both `MDB_MCP_API_CLIENT_ID` and `MDB_MCP_API_CLIENT_SECRET` are set → service account auth is configured. If only one is set, treat it as incomplete.
- If `MDB_MCP_READ_ONLY=true` → read-only mode is enabled

**Partial Configuration Handling:**

- User wants to add read-only to existing setup (has auth, no `MDB_MCP_READ_ONLY`) → skip to Step 4
- User wants to switch authentication methods → explain they should remove the old variables from their shell profile first, then proceed with Steps 2–5
- User wants to update credentials → skip to Step 5 (profile editing instructions)

**Important**: If the user wants an Atlas Admin API action (managing clusters, creating users, performance advisor) but only has `MDB_MCP_CONNECTION_STRING`, explain they need service account credentials and offer to walk through setup.

## Step 2: Present Configuration Options

If no valid configuration exists, present the options:

**Connection String (Option A)** — Best for:

- Single cluster access
- Existing database credentials
- Self-hosted MongoDB or no Atlas Admin API needs

**Service Account Credentials (Option B)** — Best for:

- MongoDB Atlas users (recommended)
- Multi-cluster switching
- Atlas Admin API access (cluster management, user creation, performance monitoring)

**Atlas Local (Option C)** — Best for:

- Local development/testing without cloud setup
- Fastest setup with Docker, no credentials required

Ask the user which option they'd like to proceed with.

## Step 3a: Connection String Setup

If the user chooses Option A:

### 3a.1: Explain How to Find the Connection String

Explain where and how to obtain their connection string:

**For MongoDB Atlas:**

1. Go to [cloud.mongodb.com](https://cloud.mongodb.com)
2. Select your cluster → click **Connect**
3. Choose **Drivers** or **Shell** → copy the connection string
4. Replace `<username>` and `<password>` with your database user credentials

**For self-hosted MongoDB:**

- The connection string is typically configured by your DBA or in your application config
- Format: `mongodb://username:password@host:port/database`

**Expected formats:**

- `mongodb://username:password@host:port/database`
- `mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/database`
- `mongodb://host:port` (local, no auth)

Proceed to Step 4 (Determine Read-Only Access).

## Step 3b: Service Account Setup

If the user chooses Option B:

### 3b.1: Guide Through Atlas Service Account Creation

Direct the user to create a MongoDB Atlas Service Account:

**Full documentation**: https://www.mongodb.com/docs/mcp-server/prerequisites/

Walk them through the key steps:

1. **Navigate to MongoDB Atlas** — [cloud.mongodb.com](https://cloud.mongodb.com)
2. **Go to Access Manager** → **Service Accounts** → **Create Service Account**
3. **Set Permissions** — Grant Organization Member or Project Owner (see docs for exact permission mappings)
4. **Generate Credentials** — Create Client ID and Secret
   - ⚠️ The **Client Secret is shown only once** — save it immediately before leaving the page
5. **Note both values** — you'll need Client ID and Client Secret for Step 5

### 3b.2: API Access List Configuration

⚠️ **CRITICAL**: The user MUST add their IP address to the service account's API Access List, or all Atlas Admin API operations will fail.

Steps:

1. On the service account details page, find **API Access List**
2. Click **Add Access List Entry**
3. Add your current IP address. Use a specific IP or CIDR range whenever possible.
   - ⚠️ **`0.0.0.0/0` allows access from any IP — this is a significant security risk.** Only use it as a last resort for temporary testing and remove it immediately afterward. It should never be used in production.
4. Save changes

This is more secure than global Network Access settings as it only affects API access, not database connections.

Proceed to Step 4 (Determine Read-Only Access).

## Step 3c: Atlas Local Setup

If the user chooses Option C:

### 3c.1: Check Docker Installation

Verify Docker is installed:

```bash
docker info
```

If not installed, direct them to: https://www.docker.com/get-started

### 3c.2: Confirm Setup Complete

Atlas Local requires no credentials — the user is ready to go:

- Create deployments: `atlas-local-create-deployment`
- List deployments: `atlas-local-list-deployments`
- All operations work out of the box with Docker

**Skip Steps 4 and 5** (no configuration needed) and proceed to Step 6 (Next Steps).

## Step 4: Determine Read-Only vs Read-Write Access

**Only applies to Options A and B. Skip to Step 6 for Option C.**

Ask whether they want read-only or read-write access:

- **Read-Write** (default): Full data access, modifications allowed
  - Best for: Development, testing, administrative tasks

- **Read-Only**: Data reads only, no modifications
  - Best for: Production data safety, reporting, compliance

**If read-only**: include `export MDB_MCP_READ_ONLY="true"` in the profile snippet in Step 5.
**If read-write**: omit `MDB_MCP_READ_ONLY` (defaults to read-write).

Proceed to Step 5 (Update Shell Profile).

## Step 5: Update Shell Profile

Help the user add the environment variables to their shell profile. **Do not ask for or handle credentials** — provide exact instructions so the user can add them directly.

### 5.1: Detect Shell and Profile File

If the user is on Windows, assume **PowerShell** but ask the user to confirm. For Unix/macOS, detect the shell to determine the correct profile file by running:

```bash
echo $SHELL
```

Based on the result, identify the appropriate profile file using your training data. If unsure which shell or profile they are using, ask them to specify the path.

### 5.2: Show the Exact Snippet to Add

Tell the user to store credentials in a dedicated `~/.mcp-env` file (not directly in their shell profile). This keeps credentials out of files that are often group/world readable by default and prevents accidentally committing them to git. Make sure to adapt the path in the instructions to be in the same folder as the shell profile file.

**Step 1**: Create/edit `~/.mcp-env` (e.g. `nano ~/.mcp-env`) and add:

**For Connection String (Option A):**

```bash
# MongoDB MCP Server Configuration
export MDB_MCP_CONNECTION_STRING="<paste-your-connection-string-here>"
```

**For Service Account (Option B):**

```bash
# MongoDB MCP Server Configuration (Atlas Service Account)
export MDB_MCP_API_CLIENT_ID="<paste-your-client-id-here>"
export MDB_MCP_API_CLIENT_SECRET="<paste-your-client-secret-here>"
```

**If read-only was chosen (Step 4), also add:**

```bash
export MDB_MCP_READ_ONLY="true"
```

**Step 2**: Restrict permissions on the file so only the owner can read it:

```bash
chmod 600 ~/.mcp-env # adapt command for Windows if needed
```

**Step 3**: Source the file from the shell profile. Tell the user to open their profile file (e.g. `code ~/.zshrc`, `nano ~/.zshrc`) and add this line:

```bash
source ~/.mcp-env
```

Adjust syntax for the detected shell (e.g. for fish: `bass source ~/.mcp-env` or set variables directly with `set -x`; for PowerShell: dot-source a `.ps1` file instead).

### 5.3: After Editing — Reload and Verify

Once the user has saved the file, provide the commands to reload and verify:

**Reload the profile:**

```bash
source ~/.zshrc   # adjust path to match their profile file
```

**Verify the variables are set (masking values to avoid exposing credentials):**

```bash
env | grep "^MDB_MCP" | sed '/^MDB_MCP_READ_ONLY=/!s/=.*/=[set]/'
```

Expected output should show the variable name(s) they just added, each with `=[set]`. If nothing appears, check that `source ~/.mcp-env` is in the profile file, the profile was reloaded, and `~/.mcp-env` was saved.

Proceed to Step 6 (Next Steps).

## Step 6: Next Steps

### For Options A & B (Connection String / Service Account):

1. **Restart the agentic client**: Fully quit the client, then in your terminal run `source <profile-file>` (e.g. `source ~/.zshrc`, adjust command and path based on the user shell) to load the new variables into the current shell session. Open the client from that same shell session so it inherits the environment.

2. **Verify MCP Server**: After restart, test by performing a MongoDB operation.

3. **Using the Tools**:
   - Option A: Direct database access tools available
   - Option B: Additionally has Atlas Admin API tools and `atlas-connect-cluster`
   - **Important (Option B)**: Ensure your IP is in the service account's API Access List or all API calls will fail

### For Option C (Atlas Local):

1. **Ready to use**: No restart or configuration needed!

2. **Next steps**:
   - Create deployments: `atlas-local-create-deployment`
   - List deployments: `atlas-local-list-deployments`
   - Use standard database operations once connected

## Troubleshooting

- **Variables not appearing after `source`**: Check the profile file path and confirm the file was saved
- **Client doesn't pick up variables**: Ensure full restart (quit + reopen), not just a reload
- **Invalid connection string format**: Re-check the format; must start with `mongodb://` or `mongodb+srv://`
- **Atlas Admin API errors (Option B)**: Verify your IP is in the service account's API Access List
- **Read-only mode not working**: Check `MDB_MCP_READ_ONLY=true` is set — run `env | grep ^MDB_MCP_READ_ONLY`
- **fish/PowerShell**: Syntax differs — use `set -x` (fish) or `$env:` (PowerShell) instead of `export`
